//The function numberChecker is declared with a single parameter num.

//The function starts with an if statement to check if num is greater than 20.

//If the condition in the first if statement is true, the code inside the block executes. It returns a string that states that the number is greater than 20, using string interpolation to include the value of num.

//If the condition in the first if statement is false, the code moves to the next else if statement.

//The second else if statement checks if num is equal to 20.

//If the condition in the second else if statement is true, the code inside the block executes. It returns a string that states that the number is equal to 20.

//If the condition in the second else if statement is false, the code moves to the next else if statement.

//The third else if statement checks if num is less than 20.

//If the condition in the third else if statement is true, the code inside the block executes. It returns a string that states that the number is less than 20.

//If the condition in the third else if statement is false, the code reaches the else block.

//The else block is a fallback for any other condition that was not met in the previous statements. It returns a string stating that num isn't even a number.

//If the function reaches this point, it means the execution has ended, and no further code is executed.

//When you pass in a string to the numberChecker function, JavaScript will attempt to compare the string with the conditions in the if statements. Since the comparisons are numerical (> for greater than, === for equality, < for less than), JavaScript will try to convert the string to a number. If the string cannot be converted to a number, the comparisons will result in NaN (Not a Number). In this case, the function will reach the else block and return the string indicating that the input isn't even a number.
